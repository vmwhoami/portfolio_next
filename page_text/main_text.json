  "description": "I am a full-stack web developer, content creator, and former professional dancer with a passion for technology, creativity, and storytelling. For over 3.5 years, I’ve been developing scalable applications using Ruby on Rails, Vue.js, and Docker, solving complex problems, and refining my expertise in backend development, API design, and front-end user experiences. But my journey started long before coding became my profession. From 2010 to 2018, I worked as a professional dancer in Moldova, Romania, and China, performing on stage while also building websites, editing videos, and designing promotional materials for my team. This hands-on experience with Photoshop, Premiere Pro, Illustrator, and web development gave me a unique perspective on blending technology with art. In 2020, I transitioned fully into tech, attending Microverse, a rigorous remote coding bootcamp, and later working as a Technical Support Engineer helping students refine their code. Since then, I’ve built web applications, APIs, and front-end experiences while also managing content creation on my YouTube channel, where I explore societal change, deep discussions, and thought-provoking ideas. I thrive in problem-solving, continuous learning, and pushing boundaries—whether it's writing clean, scalable code, crafting digital content, or exploring new technologies."
