This type of work was definitely different from web development, but it was then when I realised that in order to get clients I would need an online presence. In building that, I learned several of the skills I now use frequently as a developer. These are HTML and CSS, Bootstrap, the ability to learn fast, problem-solving, photo and video editing, working with raster images and effective communication with clients. "
